    "Bag-of-words is an algorithm that counts the occurance, and ignores order or grammar of words in a text. Words that belong together are seen as seperate words and counte seperately because the information regarding the order or structure are discarded. For example: Ice Cream (\"Ice\" and \"Cream) or High School (\"High\" and \"School\"). \n",
